In the last else part of the insertrecord....
although there is space to insert data in the datapage but there might be some cases where because of defragmentation unable to allocate....
that case not handled...for that what i had planned is in the searchDirectoryEntry function we are just checking the tfs in the directorypage
so instead of doing that go to the corresponding data page also and check whether cfs is also sufficient or not.....
----
Left in the middle the updateTable function.....
Left else part in the getInfoFromSysColumns....i.e line number 1620
Every where malloc is changed to calloc....the original version is there in google docs....check it
----
There is a problem with void show tables() there freeing the dataPage is kept comments...if i remove the comments it is showing some garbage...
check that...
