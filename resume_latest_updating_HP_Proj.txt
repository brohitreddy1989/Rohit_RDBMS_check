In Memory Databases 

 

Transaction Support in No SQL Databases. 

 

 

Projects Undertaken 

 

 

Currently 

 Transaction Support in Non-Relational Databases. 

 | Hewlett Packard ESSN R&D 

 

Role: Developer 

Programming Language: Java, C 

Non-Relational Database: HBASE 

File System: HDFS 

 

 

 Developing of Transaction Management facility to non-relational 
databases especially to HBASE using Snapshot Isolation. For 
this, we are using our own Relational Database Storage to store 
meta data for improving the speed.

 Developing a Relational DBMS(Clone of MySQL) 

 | Prof. Tridib Roy Chowdary 

 

Role: Team Leader 

Programming Language: C 

 

 

 The RDBMS includes three crucial parts DB Engine, Indexing 

and Buffer Management. The DB Engine is responsible for the 
storage of data in the hard disk, Buffer Management is used to 
bring the data from hard disk to main memory, Indexing is used 
for faster accessing.

 Data De duplication Frame Work 

 | Prof. Chandrasekhar 

 

 Role: Team Leader 

 Programming Language: Java 

 Databases used: MySQL(Relational Database) 

 HSQLDB(In Memory Database) 

 Data De duplication is a method of reducing storage needs by 

 eliminating duplicate data. This Frame work will provide you a 

 

 

 way to identify duplicate data and deleting it.

 Optimization of a Hamiltonian Path using 2 opt heuristics 

 | Prof. Chandrasekhar 

 

 Role: Team Leader 

 Programming Language: C 

 Applying 2 opt heuristics for solving the Travelling Sales Man 

 problem from the given graph.

 QR Code Customization(Currently Working On) 

 

Role: Developer 

Programming Language: Java 

 | Working for Linqr 

 

 QR code contains so much of content which is not related 

 to text or URL which you have encoded directly, these will be helpful 

 for error correction. In this project we are deleting some of the 

 code words and making the QR code attractive without affecting 

 the content of it
